		<h5 class="text-info">Advertisers will choose from the diferent types of ads and purchase ads based on how often they want their ad to appear. The higher the price of the ad, the more often the ad will be displayed. You may create as many classes of ad at any price as you like but less is better. The more classes of ads you create the longer the queue cycle will be for them to appear on our mobile app. Web site ads on your page will be displayed in the same manner.</h5>

		<h5 class="text-info">If you choose not to create ad inventory or enter sponsor information, ads will still appear when your fans visit your site on our mobile app. We encourage you to take advantage of this service to rasie funds for your program. There is a fee for using this service. Currently, we take a <%= Admin.all.first.adpercentage.to_s %>% of the ad price.</h5>

		<h5 class="text-success">You can pick any name for your ad inventory tiers. Try and pick names that your advertisers can easily associate with their respective tiers. For example ....

			<li>High, Platinum, ....</li>
			<li>Medium ,Gold, ....</li>
			<li>Low, Silver, ....</li>

		<h5 class="text-info">Because our software is sport's oriented, you can also create a player ad that is displayed only on pages associated with that player. For example, these ads would be displayed as a banner ad on the players bio page and stat's page. This is useful for  fundraising. There can only be one class of this ad and it can be priced at any price point you desire. All ads of this class will be cycled on the mobile app on the player's respective pages. Advertisers can choose this ad type to target ads associated with a specific player.
