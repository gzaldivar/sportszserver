		<h5>When you click below you will be creating the administrator for the site.</h5>
		<h5><p class="text-danger"><em>We strongly</em> recommend that you create an admin using an email address that belongs to your program. Most programs already have these but if you don't you should create one before proceeding.</p>
		You can choose to use a private email address but remember that this email will be used by us to communicate with you. It is also a good idea to use organizational emails since it will also allow your program to transfer the administration rights to the site to someone else if necessary.
		<p>
		The administrator will also have the opportunity to designate team managers who will have certain access rights to make changes like updating player bios, approving photos, etc. This capability should assist you in keeping the number of people who have access to the admin username and password to a minimum.</h5>
