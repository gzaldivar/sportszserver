		<h6>You can choose to use a private email address but remember that this email will be used by us to communicate with you.</h6>
		<h6>The administrator will also have the opportunity to designate team managers who will have certain access rights to make changes like updating player bios, approving photos, etc. This capability should assist you in keeping the number of people who have access to the admin username and password to a minimum.</h6>
